# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹
# Project README

This README provides instructions and details about the project(s).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a development build, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or Expo Go.

## Developing

To start developing, edit the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses file-based routing. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Getting a Fresh Project

If you want to start with a fresh project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
